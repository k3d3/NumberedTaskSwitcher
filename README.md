# Numbered Task Switcher
A very simple task switcher tool that runs in the background.

## Usage
There are 10 slots for windows. These are stored in the number keys on the keyboard (0-9).

## Assign
To assign the currently focused window to one of these slots, press `Alt+Shift+Slot`, where Slot is a number on your keyboard.

## Show
To show a window that was assigned to a slot, press `Alt+Slot`, where Slot is the assigned number on your keyboard.

## Example
In case the above paragraphs aren't clear enough, try this example:
- Find your browser, make sure it's the active window.
- Press Alt+Shift+0
- Now open up another program.
- Press Alt+Shift+1

Now, when you press Alt+0, the browser will become active, and when you press Alt+1, the other program will become active.
